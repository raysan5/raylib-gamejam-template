_DISCLAIMER:_

Welcome to the **raylib game template**!

This template provides a base structure to start developing a small raylib game in plain C. The repo is also pre-configured with a default `LICENSE` (zlib/libpng) and a `README.md` (this one) to be properly filled by users. Feel free to change the LICENSE as required.

All the sections defined by `$(Data to Fill)` are expected to be edited and filled properly. It's recommended to delete this disclaimer message after editing this `README.md` file.

## Getting Started with this template

### Windows: Visual Studio

- After extracting the zip, the parent folder `raylib-game-template` should exist in the same directory as `raylib` itself.  So, your file structure should look like this:
    - Some parent directory
        - `raylib`
            - the contents of https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
        - `raylib-game-template`
            - this `README.md` and all other raylib-game-template files
- If using Visual Studio, open projects/VS2022/raylib-game-template.sln
- Select on `raylib_game` in the solution explorer, then in the toolbar at the top, click `Project` > `Set as Startup Project`
- Now you're all set up!  Click `Local Windows Debugger` with the green play arrow and the project will run.
